// The reason that last line is returning true is because we are using the loose equality operator to compare if an element is `false`. When comparing two different data types of elements when using the loose equality operator, JavaScript will implicitly coerce the elements until they are the same data type. This means for our example, when we compare `0` with false, JavaScript implicitily coerces it into a boolean, and because `0` is a falsy value - it is then implicitly coerced into `false`; which in turn returns `true`.
// The way to correct this is to use the strict equality operator. By doing so, Javascript does not implicitly coerce the elements, and instead only returns `true` if they are the same type and value.
